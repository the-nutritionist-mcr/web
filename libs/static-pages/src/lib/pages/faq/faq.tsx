    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>Can I order individual meals?</h3>
      <p>We believe that a healthy, nutritional diet doesn't happen overnight. The Nutritionist MCR is your day-to-day nutritional companion, so we only offer our fresh meals as part of a subscription service. If you would like to add extra meals to your plan, that's no problem; we can just add them to your subscription.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>How can I pay for my subscription?</h3>
      <p>The easiest way to pay for your subscription is via Direct Debit which is taken on or around the 1st of every month. We also accept payment via BACS or Paypal.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>How often do you deliver?</h3>
      <p>To guarantee freshness, your meals are split into two weekly deliveries of meals that last you for three days each. All of our fresh meals are cooked to be enjoyed within three days of delivery, which is why we don't provide meals for Sunday.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>What if I’m not in to receive my meals?</h3>
      <p>Don’t worry! Your meals will be delivered in a thermal cool bag which will keep your meals at a safe temperature all day. We’re happy to leave your meals in a safe place e.g. with a concierge.</p>

    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>What if I go on holiday?</h3>
      <p>You can pause your plan for as long as you like, whenever you like. Just remember to provide us with a minimum of one week's notice, as we order our fresh ingredients one week in advance. If we've already taken your subscription payment for the month, we'll credit you your pause duration amount in the following month.</p>

      <p>Please send your pause request to <a href="mailto:pauseme@Thenutritionistmcr.com">Pauseme@Thenutritionistmcr.com</a> specifying the dates you want to pause between.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>Can the meals be frozen?</h3>
      <p>Yes, most of the freshly prepared meals are suitable for home freezing; we recommend defrosting them in the fridge for 24 hours prior to heating and they’ll taste as good as when they were delivered. Some meals such as salads don’t freeze well; look out for a sticker on these boxes.</p>

    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>What if there’s something I don’t like?</h3>
      <p>We can’t amend individual ingredients in the dishes but you can choose to swap out whole dishes in your weekly delivery. We’ll send you a weekly menu in advance so you have a chance to select which meals you would like instead.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>Can I choose my meals?</h3>
      <p>We have a wide repertoire of healthy, delicious meals. Each week we’ll send you a menu of meals for the following week. If you’d like to tailor the menu to include more of the meals you love from that menu that’s no problem just let us know by the Wednesday before for the following week's delivery.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>Is there a minimum term to my subscription?</h3>
      <p>The minimum subscription term is one month. If you decide to cancel your plan we ask for one month’s notice </p>

    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>What if my fitness &amp; nutrition goals change?</h3>
      <p>We understand. Get in touch with one of the team, we’ll discuss your new goals and help you find the plan that’s right for you. You can easily switch your plan, we just need to know seven days before the end of your current plan month.</p>

    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>I have a food allergy, can The Nutritionist Mcr provide meals for me?</h3>
      <p>As our meals are freshly prepared in one kitchen, we cannot guarantee that the meals won’t contain traces of certain allergens so currently we aren’t able to cater for those with allergies. If you’re unsure, please get in touch with one of our expert team who will be happy to advise.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="question-answer">
      <h3>Do the menus change often?</h3>
      <p>Yes. We’re continuously developing our meals. As our ingredients are always fresh, the menus change with the seasons. Expect some delicious salads and cold food for the hot summer days and warming, hearty meals during those cold winter months. Always nutritionally balanced, of course!</p>
