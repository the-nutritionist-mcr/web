            <p>
              From the humble beginnings of a South Manchester allotment plot,
              as a child our founder Ryan learned the fundamentals of growing
              food. Since then, we’ve been on a journey to discover the best
              local ingredients our British farmers and producers have to offer.
              Today, we proudly prepare, and hand deliver nutrition focused meal
              plans from our own specialist kitchen, to our clients across
              Greater Manchester.

          <h2>From our founder</h2>
          <p>
            As someone who is obsessed with good food, it seemed to me that too
            many people were missing out on the imagination, vibrancy and
            freshness needed in their functional meal prep.{' '}
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            It’s my belief that you can achieve your specific nutritional and
            fitness goals without sacrificing incredible flavours. It was out of
            this belief, that I created The Nutritionist MCR.
